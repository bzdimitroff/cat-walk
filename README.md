cat-walk
========

I'm frequently asked to provide example code or take tests when interviewing for new contract work. One recent test/task was to build something that consumes data from thecatapi.com and displays it to the user - here is the result, it took 3 hours from opening the IDE to being ready to publish.

Example cat app that pulls from The Cat API and displays a picture of a cat. Tap for more cats!
